            Kaleigh is 32 years old and lives in Fort Mill, SC. She spent the first half of her life moving around
            the midwest, then moved to Fort Mill in '98. At 19, she went to school to be a massage therapist and
            graduated from massage school in '05. She was a massage therapist for 13 years before she
            decided to make a huge jump into the world of coding. She chose coding because it was something she had
            done back in the day when she was much younger. Her keyboarding teacher encouraged her to go into computer
            science after seeing her fan page that she made for the Backstreet Boys. She wouldn't give it a second
            thought
            until years and years later when her brother, who is in IT himself, consistently nagged her.</p>

            One of Kaleigh's major passions is dog rescue. She has been fostering for several local area rescues since
            2013 and has fostered 51 dogs. She started specializing in fostering pregnant and nursing mothers in
            November 2016 when she pulled a foster who surprised everyone and ended up being pregnant. Currently,
            Kaleigh
            has taken a break from fostering mommas and has a feral mini aussie named Juniper that she is fostering.
            Juniper came from an Amish puppy mill where she lived in a cage most of her life for 8 years producing
            litter
            after litter until she couldn't produce anymore. Kaleigh's biggest goal when getting any foster is to
            socialize
            and rehabilitate the broken.
